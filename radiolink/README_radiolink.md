# sonoran_radiolink: Sonoran CAD - Sonoran Radio Link Plugin
SonoranCAD Plugin for Connecting Sonoran Radio to SonoranCAD

## Developing

Developing a plugin for the Sonoran Lua Framework is rather simple but requires you to have existing knowledge of how global and local functions and lua objects work. There is also a lot of logic built into the core framework in order to facilitate easy updating which requires particular naming and folder structure.
